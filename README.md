![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-License-green)

## Description

This text editor was mostly to figure out how and why assets, dist files, and manifesting works. It's one thing to learn about them, but replicating it in accordance to the project variables in another thing. This was also an easy intro to making our own progressive web applications.

## Installation

If the user is using this project as the files itself, they will have to start by typing 'npm run install' then 'npm run start:dev'. Otherwise, the project can be accessed via the following link:
[render link](https://text-editor-uver.onrender.com/)

## Usage

Everything starts and ends here. The only feature of this text editor is simply adding text.

If you so choose to install the application, it will display the text put down in the website too.
